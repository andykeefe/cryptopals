CryptoPals
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory has code I used to solve several [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/) exercises. CryptoPals was designed to demonstrate attacks on cryptography in the real world. I heard about this from cryptography Go maintainer [Filippo Valsorda](https://filippo.io/) and decide to give it a shot. Currently all of the code will be written in Python; I'm trying to improve my Python skills, and this is a good opportunity for it. However, once I feel I'm able, I will try these problems in another language. I'm deciding between the following:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Go
- Rust

I've little experience with Go and Rust, so this might be a good opportunity to branch out into a fresh, exciting language. 

As always, I heavily comment my code so that anyone who wants to read it for educational purposes can understand what I've written a little better. I do intend to show some of these exercises to students, especially in my Application Security class in Fall 2024. Maybe they can help me a little bit, too. :)

In addition to the code, I'm adding relatively brief write ups on the topics covered in each set. I'm keeping them as light as I can on details, but there is information related to the mathematics and history of some of these concepts. I hope this doesn't deter anyone from reading these blurbs; in fact, I hope it spurs one to read more about the subject at hand. 

Finally, a brief note on the art work at the beginning of each set. I tried to find pieces that symbolized the concepts we talk about; for example, the first set (the qualifying set) intends to build up to cryptographic concepts. For this set, I used an ancient piece showing a building process by ancient Egyptian workers. This signifies not only the nature of the set as a building block, but also the incredibly old history of cryptography as a whole.
