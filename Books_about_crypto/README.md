# Cryptography Books

Throughout the blurbs I write for each set of problems, I often make reference to various texts. This section has a complete list of texts referenced, or texts that I think are useful in understanding the topics but aren't explicitly stated. Think of it as a quick bibliography to tap into if you want to go deeper into these topics.
